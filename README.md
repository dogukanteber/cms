### Description

This is a simple Django app that lets you enroll courses. You can create 3 different course(dance, language, programming) and let other users to enroll those courses. I have deployed this project on Heroku. You can visit the webpage from this [link](https://awesomecms.herokuapp.com/).

One thing to note, Heroku does not record the data within the project. In other words, every registered user has to register again once they terminate their browser.
